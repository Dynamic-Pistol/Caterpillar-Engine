# CaterpillarEngineLib

An engine I am making is both for fun and something to suit my style of creating games, right now it is very barebones with a simple rendering system and model importing

## Planned Features
- Simple but extendable Editor
- Custom scripting language
- Physics
- Lights and shadows
- ECS
- Post-processing
- Animation
- Audio
- Visual scripting
- Easy-to-use input system
- UI system using a builder or an entity
- Misc features (splines, water system, particles, etc)

## Current State
This project is abandoned, I am currently learning C++ to rebuild it, but feel free to fork it and do whatever you want with this project
